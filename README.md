This repository contains one script, "run_analysis.R"

This script will process accelerometer data that originally came from participants smartphones and outputs averages of the mean and standard deviation for the motion of each participant in a tidy dataset.

Initially there are two data sets: a training dataset and a test dataset.  The script merges the datasets, labels the datasets, and processes the datasets.


The data for this script can be downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

To run the script:
- unzip the data archive and assign its root directory as the working directory in R
- Copy the script into the working directory
- Run script.
